# ZSC 

This is an experimental python to zscript transpiler. 

At this point in its evolution the goal is to speed the rough in of a conplex zscript, not to allow the complete 
replacement of ZScripting with python.  The ZScript language is a very narrow subset of python, and implementing 
a lot of core python concepts in ZScrtipt would be a major undertaking. This project is aimed at the more modest 
goal of quickly building up a Zscript with cleaner syntax and more predictable behaviors.
